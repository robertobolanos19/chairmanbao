        <p>Dragon's beard candy (or Chinese cotton candy) is a handmade traditional art of China. It is also a traditional Chinese sweet similar to floss halva or cotton candy, which can be found in many Chinese communities. Dragon's beard candy was initially created in China, but soon spread in popularity and became popular in other parts of East Asia such as Korea, as well as (and more recently) Canada, Turkey, Singapore, and the United States.</p>
            <br>
        <p>It has a high sugar content (19%) and low saturated fat content (2%). By comparison, cotton candy is fat free with a very high sugar content (94%). Dragon's beard candy has a very short shelf life. It is highly sensitive to moisture and tends to melt when exposed to higher temperatures, notably during warm weather.</p>

        <p>Tangyuan (traditional Chinese: 湯圓; simplified Chinese: 汤圆; pinyin: tāngyuán; lit. 'soup ball') is a Chinese dessert that is a ball of glutinous rice flour and water that has been either boiled and served in a hot broth or syrup or else deep-fried. Tangyuan can be either small or large and filled or unfilled. They are traditionally eaten during the Lantern Festival, but because the name of the dish is a homophone for union (traditional Chinese: 團圓; simplified Chinese: 团圆; pinyin: tuányuán) they are also served on wedding days, at family reunions, and during the Dōngzhì (winter solstice) festival.</p>
