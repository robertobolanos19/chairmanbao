Tangyuan can be either small or large and filled or unfilled. They are traditionally eaten during the Lantern Festival, but because the name of the dish is a homophone for union (traditional Chinese: 團圓; simplified Chinese: 团圆; pinyin: tuányuán) they are also served on wedding days, at family reunions, and during the Dōngzhì (winter solstice) festival.</p>
